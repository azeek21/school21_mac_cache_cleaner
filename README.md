School21 stopped using slack and moved on to rocket chat. There will be a new version when I have time.
TODO: features like showing freeable memory size, ability to clean selectively with some simple cli.

If asked for confirmation, hit y (yes).

rm -rf ~/Library/42_cache

rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Slack/Service\ Worker/CacheStorage/
